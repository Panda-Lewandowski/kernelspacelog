[![License][license-badge]][license-page]

## Features:
 - runs as a kernel module
 - writes log to file

## Dependencies
 - C compiler GCC
 - linux-headers for your kernel 
 - linux-source for your kernel

## Build

Simply run `make`.

## Usage

After you run `make`, see file `keylogger.ko`. This application is the keylogger. It runs silently logging to the logfile specified at the compile time (option LOG_FILE_DIR). If this file already exist, new data would be appended.
To run this keylogger you should use `insmod keylogger.ko` and `rmmod keylogger.ko` to stop it.
